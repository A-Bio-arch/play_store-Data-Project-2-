Google play_store data( project 2)
"I have combined two datasets: one containing Play Store reviews and the other containing Play Store data, using a common key called 'app.' After merging, I applied various preprocessing techniques such as one-hot encoding and standardization. Subsequently, I implemented a linear regression model for analysis and evaluated its performance using the mean R-squared metric. To enhance the model's accuracy and make more informed decisions, I plan to further refine it through advanced tuning techniques. Detailed documentation of this project, including code and findings, will be added to my GitHub README file for reference."
